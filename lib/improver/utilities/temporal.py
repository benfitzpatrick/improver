def find_required_lead_times(cube):
    """
    Determine the lead times within a cube, either by reading the
    forecast_period coordinate, or by calculating the difference between
    the time and the forecast_reference_time. If the forecast_period
    coordinate is present, the points are assumed to represent the
    desired lead times with the bounds not being considered. The units of
    the forecast_period, time and forecast_reference_time coordinates are
    converted, if required.

    Args:
        cube (Iris.cube.Cube):
            Cube from which the lead times will be determined.

    Returns:
        required_lead_times (Numpy array):
            Array containing the lead times, at which the radii need to be
            calculated.
